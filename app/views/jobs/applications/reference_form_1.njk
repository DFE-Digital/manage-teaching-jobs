                       <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Regulation 19 – Fit and proper person requirements</h2>

                       <p class="govuk-body">The post applied for is subject to Regulation 19(3)(a) of the Health and Social Care Act (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 which requires us to ensure all “Persons employed” by our organisation (including agency, bank staff and volunteers) must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>be of good character</li>
  <li>have the qualifications, competence, skills, and experience which are necessary for the work to be
performed by them, and</li>
  <li>be able by reason of their health, after reasonable adjustments are made, of properly performing tasks
which are intrinsic to the work for which they are employed.
</li>
</ul>

                       <p class="govuk-body">In order to fulfil our legal requirements, we need to make available to CQC:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>satisfactory evidence of conduct in previous employment concerned with the provision of services relating to health or social care or children or vulnerable adults;</li>
  <li>satisfactory verification as to reasons why employment ended, if candidate was employed in a position where their duties involved work with children or vulnerable adults.</li>
</ul>

                       <p class="govuk-body">It is therefore essential to require a reference from a previous employer, and the employee cannot be expected to find work of this type unless his or her employer provides a full and frank reference to a prospective employer.</p>

                       <p class="govuk-body">
When completing this reference organisations have a responsibility to ensure that the reference is accurate and does not contain any misstatement and nothing significant is omitted.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UKGDPR/Data Protection Act 2018</h2>

                       <p class="govuk-body">This form contains personal data as defined by UKGDPR/DPA 2018. It may include special category data (Article 9) and/ criminal offence data (Article 10) which has been requested for the purposes of recruitment and safeguarding adults at risk and/or children. As we are the organisation requesting this data, we will protect any information disclosed within the form in line with data protection requirements and ensure it is not passed to anyone who is not authorised to see the information.</p>

                       <p class="govuk-body">
The content of the reference may be discussed with the applicant; in addition, the applicant may request and be granted access to the reference.

                       <p class="govuk-body">However, if this reference is marked as confidential, the UKGDPR/DPA 2018 creates an exemption from:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the right to be informed (privacy information)</li>
  <li>the right to make a subject access request.</li>
</ul>
 <p class="govuk-body">Therefore, if this reference is marked as confidential, and the applicant/former employee makes a subject request BOTH the company who issued it and the company who received it – would be exempt from having to provide a copy to the applicant/former employee.
</p>
 <p class="govuk-body">
If this reference is marked confidential, it can only be disclosed to whom it is addressed and will not be released to a third party.
</p>
 <p class="govuk-body">
To ensure that a recruitment process remains open, transparent, and fair to all applicants we request that you only consider using this confidential exemption on a case-by-case basis and justify and document reasons below for relying on the confidential exemption (For example, the employee was subject to investigation for safeguarding related conduct concerns but left before investigation completed).
</p>
 <p class="govuk-body">
Referees also need to be aware that a confidential reference could be subject to disclosure in an employment tribunal or county court claim.
